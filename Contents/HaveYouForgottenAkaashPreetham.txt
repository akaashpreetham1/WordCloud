Have you forgotten those days in love,
Oblivious to everything else?
Is it because of the one above?
Mind, He ordained our romantic spells.

Have you forgotten the two of us
Lacing our fingers with awkward grace,
Vainly veiling the conspicuous,
The ardour in our clumsy embrace?

Have you forgotten those nights bygone,
Dark times lightened by a failed promise?
We made believe an illusive dawn,
One that feigned love, though it was amiss.

Have you forgotten the wretched end,
One that I wish was a wicked dream?
Albeit no dream man contrives could rend
My soul as did your deceptive scheme.

Have you forgotten, O darling mine,
That I loved you and that you loved me?
Do you know that my heart does repine
Because I have not forgotten thee?
