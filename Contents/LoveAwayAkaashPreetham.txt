Love Away

Forgotten is the sun at night,
The moon in the day, 
Did you forget when not in sight
Or when I was away?

Was it in autumn's breeze
Or in winter's hearth? 
When did our love freeze 
To its palling dearth? 

In summer's cold dread, 
I'm dying as you live. 
You're living like I'm dead, 
Not asking to forgive. 

Then spring does arrive, 
Ever so divine, 
Love — it does revive, 
Will it, yours and mine? 

Each night as the moon peers
The sun from up above, 
I await you with tears, 
My dear prodigal love.
